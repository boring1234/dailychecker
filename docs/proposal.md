## Background & Significance
The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the lives of many all over the world. It has caused many people to put their lives on pause to protect themselves and their loved ones. Coronavirus disease 2019, also known as Covid-19 is an extremely common cause of colds and upper respiratory infections. It includes similar symptoms as the common cold would present such as fever, dry cough, fatigue, nasal congestion, sore throat, headache, muscle or joint pain, chills or dizziness (4). However, Covid-19 has been known to present other unique symptoms such as loss of taste, loss of smell, and shortness of breath (4). The severity of these symptoms will depend on how an individual's immune system will respond to the virus. It affects different people in different ways. While some may be in need of ventilators and oxygen tanks, others will be asymptomatic and not aware they have the virus. Even though anyone can get infected by the virus, people over 60 years old and those with underlying health conditions are at a higher risk of becoming seriously ill.

Taking the appropriate precautions to protect yourself and not spread the virus is crucial. Covid-19 is passed through respiratory droplets that come from the nose or mouth by sneezing or coughing (4). There is a greater risk of getting the virus in places where there are large crowds close together. Due to this fact, there has been shut down of many places to contain the spread. School and non-essential businesses have switched over to virtual meetings in order to flatten the curve. The best way to protect oneself from the virus is by social distancing, wearing a mask, washing your hands and avoiding crowded places. Testing is also crucial once one develops any of the common symptoms. Following the recommended incubation period of testing 5-7 days after being exposed or having symptoms will present accurate results (4).
